# Read12: Mongo and Mongoose

## SQL:

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL NoSQL

| SQL                                                                                         | NoSQL                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                          | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database              |
| SQL databases are table based databases                                                     | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| SQL databases have predefined schema                                                        | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data                                  |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable                                                       | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable                                                  |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents                             |

<br/>

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? If the data is highly structured and clearly defined , conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.
  <br/>

- Give a real world example. SQL databases example: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
  <br/>

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? NoSQL database good fit at the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
  <br/>

- Give a real world example. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.
  <br/>

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.
  <br/>

- Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL databases are vertically scalable, But NoSQL are horizontally scalable.
  <br/> <br/>

## sql vs nosql:

- What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language used to communicate with a database. <br/>

- What is a realational database? A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
  <br/>

- Relational databases are based on the relational model
  What type of structure does a relational database work with? The logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures that relational database work with.
  <br/>

- What is a ‘schema’?Schema is a framework or concept that helps in organize and interpret information.
  <br/>

- What is a NoSQL database? \* If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you first store data for that database.
  <br/>

- How does it work?
  there is a documents, they look like JSON. and don’t have to use the same schema you can have multiple documents in one collection which have different fields.

<br/>

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  different documents in one and the same collection.

<br/>

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB is more flexible than SQL.
  <br/>

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
