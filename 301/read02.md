# Read02: State and Props

## React lifecycle:

- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

The render happens first.

- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

Mounting

- Put the following things in the order that they happen:

1. constructor
2. render
3. componentDidMount
4. React Updates
5. componentWillUnmount

- What does componentDidMount do?

This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. It's initialize the DOM and load anything using a network request.

## React State Vs Props:

- What types of things can you pass in the props?

Arguments it's can be Numbers, strings or functions.

- What is the big difference between props and state?

Props passed into the component and handled outside the component, but states handled inside the component.

- When do we re-render our application?
When we change the state inside it.

- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
Input element and checkbox
