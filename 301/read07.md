## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- Work together show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.

- Studies show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

- Good teams have two things in common. The first, everyone has the same or almost even amount of talking end expressing them selfs. And the second, sensing others emotions states or in fancy word ‘‘average social sensitivity’’. The combination of the twi will create eventually something called psychological safety

- Achieving psychological safety is not easy in any means. It is hard to force people to respect, understand and be sympathetic with each others.

- Success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.

## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding?
  Fielding is the man who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet. Also, he did researches explaining why the web works the way it does.

- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  Because the techniques were not designed with concern of that purpose. And because web pages are designed to be understood by people, machines can't use their data unless it was provided in a language and a format, machines an understand like APIs for example.

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  They created the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. the HTTP protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. That means when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

- What does a GET do?
  a GET does what it name implies, it get things through an URL, like getting the text of a site, images, videos.

- What does a POST do?
  POST adds data to a system from another system.

- What does PUT do?
  PUT replaces something from a system by another system.

- What does PATCH do?
  PATCH partially updates the data in a system from another system.
