# Read: 31 - Espresso

## Espresso
- **Espresso** tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.
- **Espresso** used to write android tests, as the example below:

```
@Test
public void greeterSaysHello() {
    onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText("Steve"));
    onView(withId(R.id.greet_button)).perform(click());
    onView(withText("Hello Steve!")).check(matches(isDisplayed()));
}
```

### Synchronization capabilities

Each time test invokes onView(), **Espresso** waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the following synchronization conditions are met:

1. The message queue is empty.
2. There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task.
3. All developer-defined idling resources are idle.

### Packages

- **espresso-core** :- Contains core and basic View matchers, actions, and assertions. See Basics and Recipes.
- **espresso-web** :- Contains resources for WebView support.
- **espresso-idling-resource** :- Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.
- **espresso-contrib** :- External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and CountingIdlingResource.
- **espresso-intents** :- Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.
- **espresso-remote** :- Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.

## Create UI tests with Espresso Test Recorder

> The **Espresso Test Recorder tool** lets you create UI tests for your app without writing any test code. 
By recording a test scenario, you can record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app. 
**Espresso Test Recorder**  takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.

- important thing to know is that Before using **Espresso Test Recorder**, make sure you turn off animations on your test device to prevent unexpected results.

- **Espresso Test Recorder** writes tests based on the Espresso Testing framework, an API in AndroidX Test. The Espresso API encourages you to create concise and reliable UI tests based on user actions. By stating expectations, interactions, and assertions without directly accessing the underlying appâ€™s activities and views, this structure prevents test flakiness and optimizes test run speed.
