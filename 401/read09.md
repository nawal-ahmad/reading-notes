## Statistics - Probability

- probability is how likely it is for something to happen; the chance of event occurence.
- normal distribution: 2D bell shaped, symmetrical graph in which the x-axis represents the values of events and the y-axis represents the   probability associated with each event, from 0 to 1.
- normal distribution is significant to probability and statistics thanks to two factors: the Central Limit Theorem and the Three Sigma Rule.


### Z-score:
- The Z-score is a simple calculation that answers the question.
“Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?” The equation below is the Z-score equation.
- Statistics doesn’t have to be a field relegated to just statisticians.
