# Read35: Graphs


## Graphs

non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

 **Terminology**

1. Vertex : also called a “node”, a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge : a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes.
4. Degree : the number of edges connected to that vertex.

**Undirected Graphs**

> Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

**Directed Graphs (Digraph)**

>A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

**Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected**

1. Complete Graphs:  when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
2. Connected:  has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
3. Disconnected: when some vertices may not have edges.

**Acyclic vs Cyclic**

> cycle: is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

1. Acyclic Graph: a directed graph without cycles.
2. Cyclic Graphs: is a graph that has cycles.

**Weighted Graphs**

> A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.


**examples of graphs in use**:

1. GPS and Mapping
2. Driving Directions
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
