# Read 14: Data Visualization

* Data visualization: the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.


**matplotlib**: is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. 
- To create a scatter plot in Matplotlib we use the scatter method. 
- giving the graph more meaning by coloring in each data-point by its class.
- comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. such as: figure size and dpi, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. 

**pyplot** : provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments.

**IPython**: is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.


The scatter plot is a mainstay of statistical visualization. It depicts the joint distribution of two variables using a cloud of points, where each point represents an observation in the dataset. This depiction allows the eye to infer a substantial amount of information about whether there is any meaningful relationship between them.

**Seaborn**: is a high-level interface, great default styles
* The Python visualization library Seaborn is based on matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

**- The basic steps to creating plots with Seaborn are:**
    1. Prepare some data
    2. Control figure aesthetics
    3. Plot with Seaborn
    4. Further customize your plot
