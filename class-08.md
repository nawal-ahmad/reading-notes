### Chapter 15: “Layout” 

- This was from reading before in [class-04](class-04.md)

- CSS treats each HTML element as boxes.
    -Block-level elements which start on a new line such as `<h>``<p>``<ul>``<li>`
    -Inline elements which flow between surrounding text such as `<img>``<b>``<i>`
    -Containing elements which is outer box containing two block-level element inside each other.
- CSS float property specifies how  element float.
- Controlling the position of elements by three scheme:
    - Normal flow
    - Relative positioning
    - absolute positioning
- Using box offset to determine where box should be positioned:
    - Fixed positioning
    - Floating positioning
- Overlapping elementts
- CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.
- The design needs to be able to work on different sized screens
- Layout types:
    - [Fixed-width layout ](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/fixed-width-layout.html)
    - [Liquid layout](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/liquid-layout.html)
    -[Grid Layout](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/grid-layout.html)
- HTML can include multiple CSS files in one page.

- z-index attribute is used when overlapping to control which element is on the top of the other element by setting a value for this z-index, the higher the number the closer the element to the front.
